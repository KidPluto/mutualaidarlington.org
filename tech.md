Working from home and can't connect?  Figuring out how to setup video calls?  Missing a cable, or need computer help?  We have lots of geek volunteers in Arlington - we're organizing a list for you!

## Get Technology Help

[View our list of technology volunteers](/techhelp) who may be able to help you.  Please remember: [these geeks are all volunteers](/techhelp) with busy lives, so give them time to respond, and be sure to say thanks!

## Volunteer To Help

Are you a geek who can help?  Volunteer your tech skills here for any Arlington residents by [filling in our Google Form for tech volunteers](https://forms.gle/uwiPfacsSabgk9v67).

[See the techhelp page](/techhelp), now a searchable, categorized list of people available.  If there's interest, we might be able to allow tech volunteers to do so semi-anonymously, only sharing contact details with specific people looking for help.

**NOTE:** Currently Shane is building this site, although I'm talking to a few other Arlingtonians about coordinating efforts.  If you want to help maintain this meta-coordination site, please [submit the Tech Volnteer Form](https://forms.gle/uwiPfacsSabgk9v67) and tick the box for site admin.

## Technology Ideas For Kids

There are plenty of lists of activities or remote learning for kids these days of closed schools out there.  But in terms of technology, here are a few focused suggestions.
