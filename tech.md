# How To Get Technology Help From Arlington Neighbors

Working from home and can't connect?  Figuring out how to setup video calls?  Missing a cable, or need computer help?  We have lots of geek volunteers in Arlington - let's organize them!

## Get Technology Help

**IN PROGRESS**

We're actively looking for new tech volunteers; once we have some, there will be a list of people to help here, categorized by what they can help with (video calls, wifi, software, hardware, etc.).  _Stay Tuned!_

### Tech Volunteers So Far

- [Shane Curcuru](mailto:menotomy@shanecurcuru.org?Subject=MutualAidArlington Tech Suggestion): help with this website or coordinating with other Mutual Aid groups
- [David Coletta](mailto:david@colettas.org): Videoconferencing using: Zoom, FaceTime, BlueJeans; also macOS

## Volunteer To Help

Are you a geek who can help?  Volunteer your tech skills here for any Arlington residents by [filling in our Google Form for tech volunteers](https://forms.gle/uwiPfacsSabgk9v67).

Once we have some volunteers, we'll make this page a searchable, categorized list of people available.  If there's interest, we might be able to allow tech volunteers to do so semi-anonymously, only sharing contact details with specific people looking for help.

**NOTE:** Currently Shane is building this site, although I'm talking to a few other Arlingtonians about coordinating efforts.  If you want to help maintain this meta-coordination site, please [submit the Tech Volnteer Form](https://forms.gle/uwiPfacsSabgk9v67) and tick the box for site admin.

## Proposed Work Plans

- Turn available tech volunteers into CSV and display categorized listing with a _layout
- Create a hardware donation / hardware needs matching service or docs
- Add mapping to the pods page: see if we can do something easier to manage than MAMAS pod map (has a lot of manual maintenance)

## Contact Site Admins 

Propose a GitHub PR or email [menotomy@shanecurcuru.org](mailto:menotomy@shanecurcuru.org?Subject=MutualAidArlington Tech Suggestion) with your suggestions.

**Good luck!**
