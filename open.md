# What Stores Are Open And When?

With the [state order for non-essential businesses to close](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/covid-19-essential-services), and with many stores holding "at-risk" or senior-only shopping hours, where and when can you find open stores?  Luckily, the town and some volunteers are working on this!

## Arlington Business Open / Closed Listings

There are currently three actively managed listings of businesses in town!

- The town lists [Arlington Open Businesses](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o9EW1jBsm95ucDC2cCcpRVLtMPJVUbrJEg5fTyYrqwQ/) by working directly with business owners for updates.

## At-Risk And Senior Only Shopping Hours

Many businesses, especially larger stores, have set aside specific hours in the morning for at-risk individuals or seniors.  Please respect their policies, and only shop during those hours if you truly have risk factors!
