# Neighbors Cheering Up Neighbors!

Along with the many places to volunteer or get help these days, Arlington neighbors are spreading cheer in many social distancing appropriate ways.  Spring weather is here - get outside, take a walk, and look for bits of cheer all around you.

## We're Going On A Bear Hunt!

Dori on the A-list has started an amazing group of bear-lovers for kids to keep their eyes out for. <i class="fa fa-paw"></i> Like the kid's story ([told on video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Waoa3iG3bZ4)!), neighbors are putting teddy bears (and other things) in their windows or porches as a scavenger hunt for families to look out for when taking a walk.  Check out the current bear sightings around town!
