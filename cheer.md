# Neighbors Cheering Up Neighbors!

Along with the many places to volunteer or get help these days, Arlington neighbors are spreading cheer in many social distancing appropriate ways.  Spring weather is here - get outside, [take a long walk](/active), and look for bits of cheer all around you.

## We're Going On A Bear Hunt! <i class="fa fa-paw"></i>

Dori on the A-list has started an amazing group of bear-lovers for kids to keep their eyes out for.  Like the children's story ([told on video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Waoa3iG3bZ4)!), neighbors are putting teddy bears (and other things) in their windows or porches as a scavenger hunt for families to look out for when taking a walk.  Check out the current bear sightings around town!

**Does Your Bear Want To Play?**

Thanks for contributing to the Hunt!  If you have a Google/Gmail account, just [add yourself to this editable spreadsheet](https://tinyurl.com/u59mm5y) of Arlington bears!  Please ask your bears to follow our three rules:

- Please update your listing if your bear goes into hibernation, so no-one worries if they aren't found.
- If you spot an “unregistered” bear, [add its general location to the list](https://tinyurl.com/u59mm5y) (e.g. “Gray house on Fairmont”), but do NOT include the address without permission from the bear-er.
- Please share on social media! We've only been showcasing this on A-list and FB so far. Happy hunting!
