Along with the many places to volunteer or get help these days, Arlington neighbors are spreading cheer in many social distancing appropriate ways.  Spring weather is here - get outside, [take a long walk](/active), and look for bits of cheer all around you.

## We're Going On A Bear Hunt! <i class="fa fa-paw"></i>

Dori on the A-list has started an amazing group of bear-lovers for kids to keep their eyes out for.  Like the children's story ([told on video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Waoa3iG3bZ4)!), neighbors are putting teddy bears (and other things) in their windows or porches as a scavenger hunt for families to look out for when taking a walk.  Check out the current bear sightings around town!

**Does Your Bear Want To Play?**

Thanks for contributing to the Hunt!  There's a [whole website devoted to Arlington Bears and friends](https://sites.google.com/view/arlington-bear-hunt)!  Please ask your bears to follow our three rules:

- Please update your listing if your bear goes into hibernation, so no-one worries if they aren't found.
- If you spot an “unregistered” bear, [add its general location to the list](https://tinyurl.com/u59mm5y) (e.g. “Gray house on Fairmont”), but do NOT include the address without permission from the bear-er.
- Please share on social media! We've only been showcasing this on A-list and FB so far. Happy hunting!
