## Website Administrator Corner

This is currently a scratch pad of ideas for the website itself.  Shane is hoping some of our technology volunteers will have time to step up and work on some improvements (or just help maintain links / add relevant new resources).

## Website Improvement Ideas

- Change to a GitHub Pages `remote_theme: mmistakes/minimal-mistakes`
- Put in relevant header graphics/social media preview images
- Setup an admin volunteer team page, listing core admin contacts / give credit
- Normalize on single mutuaaidarlington@ email address (Morgen/Shane)
- Create a hardware donation / hardware needs matching service or docs
- Add better mapping to the pods page: see if we can do something easier to manage than MAMAS pod map (has a lot of manual maintenance)
- Writeup simple instructions for creating Google Forms intake -> Sheet -> Map so it's turnkey to add new /cheer features like bear hunt and egg hunt
- Find a robust and zero-maintenance contact form to allow volunteers to obscure their email addresses on the site (i.e. so matching or people requesting help use a form, meaning volunteers are less likely to get random spam direct to their email address)
- Integrate slack workspace for admins/core volunteers
