# How To Setup Your Pod

Volunteering to be a Neighborhood Point Person for a pod is easy - we've got all of these resources to help you get started!

[Setup a Pod](/pods/setup) | [Flyer Template](/pods/flyer) | [Conversation Guide](/pods/conversation) | [Arlington Pods Map](/pods/map) | [More Resources](/pods/resources)

## How to build your pod

Fill out the [Arlington Pod Volunteer Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeBp1E8eVqW1OqDKWHoygncmGdjNieRRVBexVavlRg9YP6U7A/viewform?usp=sf_link) to signup as a Neighborhood Point Person (NPP). We’ll follow up with you by email or text, add you to our WhatsApp group chat for Arlington point people, and help you setup a pod region on our [Arlington Pods Map](/pods/map) (also to eventually be represented on this wider Boston Mutual Aid map) within 1-2 days. 

## Getting Started With Neighbors

Print (or write out!) copies of our recommended [Flyer Template](/pods/flyer) and deliver to your neighbors. You might deliver 30+ fliers to the houses/apartments right around where you live. For germ avoidance, we suggest just leaving the flier somewhere they will notice it.  (We're also working on a guide to keeping safe while passing out flyers)

_Note:_ It is illegal to put things in other people’s mailboxes: try the crack of their door, between screen door and main door, etc.

Safety advice: leave off your house number when writing your own address.

Please wash your hands before posting flyers to doors and wear gloves and/or a mask if you can. **DO NOT flyer** if you or someone in your household is sick. Here’s more info about properly washing hands, sanitizing, how to wear a mask, and how to wear gloves.

The flyers are to exchange contact info, in order to start a text thread (or whatsapp, signal, slack, facebook messenger, whatever!) or a phone tree. 
FLYER ASAP BEFORE THERE ARE RESTRICTIONS ON LEAVING HOME

## Pick a name for your pod!

Pick a fun name! My dad’s pod is “the Peralta Street Blockheads”.  Many neighborhoods already have local connections, especially in the many private ways in Arlington.  Neighbors are often more comfortable if they recognize nearby neighbors doing flyering or volunteering to help.

## Building out your pod

Create a group chat for your neighborhood and as people text you, add them to the group. We recommend WhatsApp but whatever works for you all.
Troubleshoot as needed - helping folks download whatsapp and get set up if they need it, answering questions, and asking neighbors to help bring more people in. 

Neighborhood Pods should be between 5 and 30 or so people, if there are more than 30 neighbors interested, figure out how to split up into two pods.
Stay in touch with folks. Use the conversation guide below to get a sense of what support needs may come up in your pod. Share wider-community resources.

## Connecting to other pods

Join the Arlington Pod Point People Whatsapp group chat (no link so far - we will invite you!) to connect with other pods. You may want to ask for resources that your pod doesn’t have, ask for advice, share successes, or offer ideas to others.
