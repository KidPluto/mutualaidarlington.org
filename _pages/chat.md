Got questions but you're in a hurry?  You can chat with real live librarians who volunteer their time to help point you in the right direction!

Ask a Librarian can't help deliver groceries or find TP in stock, but they probably can point you to a page that does help.  They're librarians, after all, and they're really good at finding trusted and useful sources for you, just like at your local library.

## Ask A Librarian

If you've got questions for a librarian, but can't get to Robbins or Fox libraries these days, then try asking a volunteer librarian here!

## Reminder: All Chats Are Logged

The Ask A Librarian chat is staffed by professional librarians volunteering their time from around the US, not by local Arlington, MA librarians or volunteers.  They may have their own data privacy policy, and their chat tool above may log IP addresses and may save chats for their own internal work. 


**Thank your local librarians too!**
