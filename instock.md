Looking to find some fresh produce?  Need gluten-free flour, or anything else special?  Just need some TP!?!?  Let's crowdsource reporting what's in stock in our [local supermarkets](/open)!

## Nearby Supermarket Stock Reports

Click on a store to see reports, and then click on Make A Report on any store if you go out and notice anything!  Remember: reports come from you or your neighbors, so always double-check yourself by calling if something is important.

We hope to add easier ways for you to edit the above reports, as well as a listing of local stores in a table soon!

### Got More Ideas?

[Email us your suggestions](mailto:MutualAidArlington@gmail.com?Subject=[MAA] Instock Suggestion) - we update this site frequently!  In particular, we want to know what to add:
- More stores?  If there's enough demand for specific stores, we'll add'em.
- Better reports? Should we color-code low stock stores?
- Other specific instock columns?  We can't add too many, but if we get a lot of specific requests we will.
- Ideas for better help for this page, especially on mobile (your neighborhood developer is always on their laptop...)
