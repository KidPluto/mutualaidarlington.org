**Pods are hyperlocal text message groups or phone trees of you and your neighbors.** Since not everyone has access to online communication, neighborhood pods are how we reach more people. 

## Volunteer To Setup A Pod

We are asking for folks to sign up as **Neighborhood Point People**, where you’d take on the responsibility of reaching out to your neighbors, moderating a neighborhood group chat or phone tree (on WhatsApp or another communication tool), and staying in touch with the other point people for resource sharing.

If you have the capacity to take on this role, please let us know ASAP by filling out [this survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeBp1E8eVqW1OqDKWHoygncmGdjNieRRVBexVavlRg9YP6U7A/viewform), and we’ll set you up with a [toolkit](https://tinyurl.com/how-to-pod-arlington) of how to get started.

## Looking to join your Neighborhood Pod?
Look here to see if your pod already exists, and click on the shapes to see contact info for your neighborhood point person to get connected.

Please note, we are just kicking this program off, and new pods are springing up every day!

## Pods are part of a larger mutual aid network!

See a larger a [map of pods in our neighboring towns](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1502kJVz29cyu9qB_uLTLvujt0VET_Gc3&usp=sharing). This broader pods map is maintained by [Mutual Aid Medford and Somerville](https://mutualaidmamas.com/). Our pods program (and much of our infrastructure) is adapted from their frameworks.
