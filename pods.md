# What Are Local Volunteer Pods?

Local volunteering is sometimes complicated when you don't know the people you're working with.  **Pods** are hyper-local volunteer groups that can say #WeGotOurBlock! 

**Want To Volunteer Your Pod Today?**

Great!  Medford and Somerville already have a great pod system and map that includes some Arlington groups.  If you'd like to get setup in the MAMAS Pod system, [fill out Neighborhood Point Person volunteer form](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdsdGeYXv0cH3TxrMQSBp9A0h9dghnVzl_FajnZdVVAUF2WVg/viewform?usp%3Dsf_link&sa=D&ust=1584156198286000) now!  They also have a [Pod Setup Toolkit document](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j8ADhLEuKNDZ1a_opmzudywJPKMXcNKu01V1xY2MiIA/edit&sa=D&ust=1584156198286000) with ideas.

> As things get harder, we show up for our neighbors. As a Neighborhood Point Person (NPP), youâ€™d take on the responsibility of reaching out to your neighbors, checking in on what needs are arising on your block, coordinating a neighborhood group chat or phone tree, and staying in touch with the point people from other neighborhoods for resource pooling.

## Volunteers Needed!

I'm in talks now with some other volunteers with hyper-local groups already setup to see if we want to setup our own Arlington-based pod structure, or just use the [existing maps for Medford/Somerville.](https://mutualaidmamas.com/)

Resources will include a map showing pod areas (probably precincts), and a list of the Neighborhood Point Person (NPP) for each pod, who can help organize any block-level volunteers or services.  This allows people on a set of blocks who might know some neighbors to be more comfortable volunteering nearby.
