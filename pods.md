# What Are Local Volunteer Pods?

_As things get harder, we show up for our neighbors._ As a neighborhood point person, youâ€™d take on the responsibility of reaching out to your neighbors in a nearby pod, checking in on what needs are arising on your block, coordinating a neighborhood group chat or phone tree, and staying in touch with the point people from other neighborhoods for resource pooling. We are trying to build a network of many neighborhood pods across town.

Local volunteering is sometimes complicated when you don't know the people you're working with.  **Pods** are hyper-local volunteer groups that can say #WeGotOurBlock!

## Volunteer To Setup A Pod

Wondering how to get started?  We have a [Guide For Setting Up Your Pod](/pods/setup), and we offer help and tips on keeping organized, like a [flyer to hand out](/pods/flyer) and a [guide for talking to neighbors](/pods/conversation).

## Look For Help Nearby

We have the first few neighborhood pods setup on our [map of Arlington pods that can help](/pods/map).

### Thank You Medford And Somerville!

Medford and Somerville have a lot of organized volunteers, and have been pioneering a variety of ways neighbors can help neighbors.  They documented how [anyone in Medford/Somerville can volunteer or get help](https://mutualaidmamas.com/), with a [detailed map of hyper-local pod volunteers](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1502kJVz29cyu9qB_uLTLvujt0VET_Gc3&usp=sharing).  

They even have instructions on [how to organize mutual aid in your own town](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ca-sz4DRNvUg8ezcrfd6awH-ahxBDJwnbdzxm4_qDVs/edit), which we volunteers here in Arlington thank them for, since we've copied a lot of their work!
