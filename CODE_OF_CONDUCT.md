## Code of Conduct for Contributors

This site is run by Shane Curcuru (looking for more admins!), and is meant as a resource for Arlington residents find trusted resources or connect with neighbors and volunteers during the age of COVID-19.

Contributors and participants in the GitHub project infrastructure are expected to be excellent to each :smiley_cat: :dog: other, and in general follow the widely-used [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct version 1.4](https://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/).

Opening a GitHub Issue detailing any unnaceptable behavior within this project is the preferred way to report problems; however if for any reason you wish to make a report privately, you may email **complete** details of the errant behavior, as well as **why** you believe the behavior is inappropriate, to menotomy@shanecurcuru.org.  All reports will be treated as confidentially as practical (meaning: if I get a subpoena, I may have to turn over emails).
