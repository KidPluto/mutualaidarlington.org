## Brief Site Architecture Plans

The purpose of this site is to be a front page that links in a smart and easy-to-understand way to the many other volunteer groups springing up in Arlington around COVID-19.  If we can find ways to help individual volunteer groups organize and communicate better, great - but many volunteers already have ways they like doing things, and we want to support them, not supplant anyone's work.

**Rough Architecture Ideas**

- Use GitHub Pages for the core site - reliable, zero maintenance, eventually can get non-coders to propose changes using the web forms on github
- Store meta-lists of stores, libraries, other rarely changing data as .csv files (easy to edit or share) that are displayed as lists (see detailed example over in [MenotomyMatters.com](https://menotomymatters.com/townhall/) - [HTML layout](https://github.com/ShaneCurcuru/menotomymatters/blob/master/_layouts/committees.html))
- Evaluate using the MAMAS set of Google Docs to setup proposed pod listings (hyper-local communities) or self-editing lists of people volunteering 
- Link to existing Google Docs or other groups first, and see where making technical suggestions might help those groups (or not)

**Note:** the focus for this site is specific to Arlington, MA.  We should just link out to any larger efforts that others are already doing.
