### Need Your Help <i class="fa fa-exclamation"></i>

I'm [actively looking for collaborators](/tech#volunteer-to-help) to help turn this site into a master jump-off point to better publicise the many different volunteer groups and efforts in Arlington.  Read about my [ideas for this site over on MenotomyMatters](https://menotomymatters.com/howto/covid-organize/), my Arlington-focused blog and [see the CONTRIBUTING guide](https://github.com/ShaneCurcuru/mutualaidarlington.org/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Credits

Arlington has a number of great volunteer groups that have been self-organizing individual lists - of people able to drive, where to get supplies, or the like - so many thanks to those volunteering.  But we need a way to coordinate between them all.  This site takes inspiration from one just a town over from us, the [Mutual Aid Medford And Somerville Network](https://mutualaidmamas.com/).  Thanks to them for coming up with a structure and for suggestions on how to duplicate their framework!
