# Neighbors Helping Neighbors in Arlington, MA

**Mutual Aid Arlington** is here to connect neighbors with the many awesome volunteer groups here in Arlington, MA while [many of us are sheltering at home](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/departments/health-human-services/health-department/coronavirus-information) much of the time.  [Volunteers are needed](/tech#volunteer-to-help) to help coordinate, communicate, and code this website!

**TOWN ALERT 20-March** [Arlington now recommends residents stay home](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/departments/health-human-services/health-department/coronavirus-information) if possible:

> Public health officials urge that regardless of your age, you follow their request to stay at home and away from non-family contacts at this time. Due to the lack of testing they do not believe they are able to adequately contain coronavirus through quarantining of cases at this time. It is critical that we work together as the caring community that we are and follow this crucial step to prevent widespread illness in Arlington.

### Need Your Help

I'm [actively looking for collaborators](/tech#volunteer-to-help) to help turn this site into a master jump-off point to better publicise the many different volunteer groups and efforts in Arlington.  Read about my [ideas for this site over on MenotomyMatters](https://menotomymatters.com/howto/covid-organize/), my Arlington-focused blog and [see the CONTRIBUTING guide](https://github.com/ShaneCurcuru/mutualaidarlington.org/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Credits

Arlington has a number of great volunteer groups that have been self-organizing individual lists - of people able to drive, where to get supplies, or the like - so many thanks to those volunteering.  But we need a way to coordinate between them all.  This site takes inspiration from one just a town over from us, the [Mutual Aid Medford And Somerville Network](https://mutualaidmamas.com/).  Thanks to them for coming up with a structure and for suggestions on how to duplicate their framework!
