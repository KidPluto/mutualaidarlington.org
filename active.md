# Keep Active!

Spring weather is here - get outside, take a walk, and look for [bits of cheer](/cheer) all around you.  Here are resources to keep you entertained and moving around if you're stuck at home.  **Remember:** [Arlington playgrounds are closed](https://twitter.com/arlingtonmagov/status/1243885687641911303) to prevent COVID-19 spread.

## Mental Health Resources

With various stay at home orders, doctors are using new tools for telemedecine and remote visits, and many insurance companies have updated their policies for mental and physical health visits.  It's worth a call to your provider to see how to still get help staying at home.
