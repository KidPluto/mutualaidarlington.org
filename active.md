# Keep Active!

Spring weather is here - get outside, take a walk, and look for [bits of cheer](/cheer) all around you.  Here are resources to keep you entertained and moving around if you're stuck at home.  **Remember:** [Arlington playgrounds are closed](https://twitter.com/arlingtonmagov/status/1243885687641911303) to prevent COVID-19 spread.

- [Go on a bear hunt](/cheer#bear) with kids around town.
- Take a walk!  There are several local maps for walkers:
  - Arlington's own [Open Space Committee has simple local walks](https://arlingtonma.gov/openspace)
  - Walk Boston has some [short guided walks in Arlington](https://bit.ly/Arlington_Walking_Map)
  - Head next door for some [great walks in Belmont](https://walkboston.org/2012/03/19/belmont-walking-map/)
- Just [step outside at 6PM and say hello to your neighbors](https://twitter.com/arlingtonmagov/status/1244338726601478151) with the town #Arlington6At6 program!
