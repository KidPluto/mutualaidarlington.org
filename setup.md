Key technical tips on organizing tools to use for volunteering in your local community.  We also have resources on the non-technical side: [finding volunteers and organizing the human side of the work](/local).

## What Are Your Site's Goals?

Much like any major project, do some planning first.  This includes thinking through the overall mission/goal statements - write them down!, and figuring out who your core volunteers are.  Whatever technology choices you make need to fit both your goals (outreach, needs matching, advocacy) with your available volunteer resources.  Consider both what your **core volunteers** are passionate about, as well as their skillsets.  If only one person knows how to use some bit of technology, it's a single point of failure to consider.

Also, consider your **audience** size and location - both physically, and online. Many people love Facebook groups - but some people refuse to use Facebook.  Same goes for most other messaging and group tools.  So when thinking about outreach, ensure you have publicly-viewable URLs to share.  This is where the Twitter / Instagram model of having an implicitly public timeline is an advantage.  Audience size also matters: if you're building a hyper-local volunteer pod with a few hundred people, you can get away with a Google Doc or similar homepage.  If you're serving a larger community, you'll need a dedicated and performant landing page to welcome people.

## Communications

How do people find out about your group?  While some outreach may be flyers, phone trees, or yard signs, a lot of people will find you online.  You both want newcomers to your site to find the information they need, and to feel comfortable trusting your site.

A key way to make a site more professional looking as well as performant is to ensure your main landing page is at a stable URL (your own domain name is best) and is not a complex document.  Google Docs have been slow across the board recently with all the new users there.  That's not a good UX experience for newcomers.

There are two conceptual things to do here:

- **Mentally break up your site design.**  Large and complex pages tend to make people's eyes glaze over, and are harder to manage for your core volunteers.  Break up your design, and think of having a few key landing pages: the homepage, Get Help, and Volunteer Here are great starts.  Then focus on designing those three or so pages well, with short, concise descriptions.  From there, use action words and very clear links out to any other coordination forms or spreadsheets you use, where volunteer teams may do daily work.

- Consider using traditional technologies for your landing pages.  One fast and free way to host static web pages is [GitHub Pages](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/).  They take a tiny bit of tech skill to get setup, but once done, they are zero maintenance, fast, and won't go down.  There are plenty of other web hosting solutions, including [Google Sites](https://sites.google.com/new) and similar places.  Focus on keeping content directly on the landing pages simpler and action focused - and then link people to your working areas.  Remember, the web is all about **linking**.  You can also embed parts of a Google doc into a plain web page too.

**Other key communication tips**

- Social media: many people don't use Facebook, so consider adding a twitter / instagram feed for key announcements
- Be sure to list contact people or monitored email addresses.  It's important for new users to understand who's running your site.
- Always have a prominent About This Site / Who We Are section.  It really helps newcomers to trust your group if they know who's running it.  When practical, also include contact information here.

## Consider Your Own Domain Name

Having your own domain name for a group makes it much easier to share the address, and looks more professional.  Domain names are about 10USD/year, and are fairly simple to point to your site.  More importantly, once setup, they're stable.  While tinyurl or bit.ly may be convenient short-term, those link shortners do go down sometiems, making them less reliable.

## Use A License

In the US, everything you write down is copyrighted.  Legally, other people can't re-use your writing except thru small bits of "fair use".  It's simple to use a license for your website so that you explicitly allow other people to re-use or share all your content.

There are plenty of guides for using [open source](https://opensource.org/licenses) or [Creative Commons licenses](http://creativecommons.org/).  For most content, I [recommend CC-BY license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which is the simplest license that merely asks anyone else using your stuff to credit you. Note that when you give other people a license, you still maintain your own copyright: you can always re-use your own work. You can also use [CC0 public domain declaration](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/), where you explicitly forego copyright.

Applying a license to your site is as simple as putting a license declaration in the footer of your webpages.
